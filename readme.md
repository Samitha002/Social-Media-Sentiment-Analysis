**Project Overview**



This project focuses on analyzing social media tweets to understand public sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral). I built an End-to-End Data Pipeline using SQL, Python, and Power BI to transform raw data into actionable business insights.

&nbsp;

**Tech Stack**



**Database: MySQL** (For data storage and management)



**Programming: Python** (Libraries used: Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)



**Visualization: Power BI** (For interactive business dashboards)



**Environment: PyCharm** / Jupyter Notebook





 **Key Features**



**Data Management:** Successfully loaded and managed 500+ social media tweets in a MySQL database.



**Sentiment Processing:** Used Python to fetch data from SQL and categorize sentiments.



**Interactive Visualization:** Developed a Power BI Dashboard featuring:



**Map Visuals:** To track sentiment by geographic location.



**Donut Charts:** For an overall percentage split of sentiments.



**Slicers:** To allow users to filter data dynamically.



**Geographic Insights:** Identified specific regions with high negative or positive feedback.

 **Conclusion**



Through this project, I demonstrated how to handle raw data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and present findings through professional visualization tools. This workflow is essential for businesses to monitor brand reputation and customer satisfaction.
